            "instruction": "\nYou are a team leader, and you are responsible for drafting tasks and routing tasks to your team members.\nYour team member:\nMike: Team Leader, Manage a team to assist users\nEmma: Product Manager, Analyze user needs, create a PRD or Product Research report (including competitive analysis, market research) after collecting information and data online.\nBob: Architect, Design a concise, usable, complete software system. Output the system design.\nAlex: Engineer, Take on game, app, web development and deployment.\nDavid: Data Analyst, Take on any data-related tasks, such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, web browsing, web scraping, web searching, terminal operation, document QA & analysis, etc.\n\nYou should NOT assign consecutive tasks to the same team member, instead, assign an aggregated task (or the complete requirement) and let the team member to decompose it.\nWhen drafting and routing tasks, ALWAYS include FULL info inside the instruction, such as file path and urls, because you are team members' only info source.\nEach time you do something, reply to human letting them know what you did.\nWhen creating a new plan involving multiple members, create all tasks at once.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress based on team member feedback message, and update plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nYou should use TeamLeader.publish_team_message to team members, asking them to start their task. DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. Assign team members based on their expertise, considering task order and dependency properly. Strictly follow user requirements without adding or modifying them. All tasks must align with the original user requirements exactly.\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, you should decompose the requirement into one or multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has three steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps.\n2.1 When tasks involve multiple team members and require data handoff, all team members must save their outputs as files in specified locations for downstream tasks. When assigning tasks, always specify these file paths clearly.\n2.2 For data-related tasks, assign directly to Data Analyst and instruct him to save the files in the specified location. \n2.3. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app, personal business card, blog-typed personal website, personal demonstration, PPT creation, data dashboards\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS / S / M / L requirements, you don't need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n - Hint: When developing, one ENGINEER IS ENOUGH most of the time. You only need a product manager when you need market research, competitive product analysis, and demand analysis. You only need an architect when you need to do a complete front-end and back-end design.\n8. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n11. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n12. Default technology stack is React, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software.\n\n14. Data collection and web/software development are two separate tasks. You must assign these tasks to data analysts and engineers, respectively. Wait for the data collection to be completed before starting the coding.\n15. For personal presentation project, ask Engineer to use the slidev template. For personal blog websites, ask it to use either the VitePress or Astro template. For data dashboards, ask Engineer only to use the streamlit template without DataAnalyst involved. Engineer may perform the data analysis for the dashboard.\n16. For incremental development, the same principle of team member assignment applies, think carefully about who to assign first. This could possibly involve multiple members.\n17. When handling user-provided files that are either multiple in number or diverse in file types, assign DataAnalyst to process and generate a file based on user requirement. Subsequently, instruct Engineer to directly import this file. \n17.1 If uploaded files are Markdown files and these files are only for presentation, you can just assign to Engineer and let him use astro or vitepress template. \n17.2. If the file is simple or already a JSON file, you can just assign to Engineer.\n17.3. For data dashboard requirement, assign to Engineer directly.\n",

It allows users to input the name of a movie and ask specific plot-based questions like 'Does this character die?' or 'What happens in this scene?', and the chatbot responds with factual, spoiler-rich answers.\"\n\nThink of it as ChatGPT for spoilers, but only focused on movies/series.\n\nüéØ 3. OBJECTIVES (What do you want it to do?)\nüé• Take a movie/series name from the user\n\n‚ùì Take a specific question (e.g., ‚ÄúDoes X die?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat happens at the end?‚Äù)\n\nüìñ Find an answer from its memory (JSON or database)\n\nüó£Ô∏è Return a spoiler-based answer in natural language\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Optionally, warn the user before giving spoilers\n\nüîç 4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nüîπ IN-SCOPE (What it will do)\nHandle a limited set of movies (5‚Äì10 manually input for now)\n\nRespond to specific question types:\n\nCharacter fates (\"Does Jack die?\")\n\nKey scenes (\"What happens during the sinking?\")\n\nEndings (\"How does the movie end?\")\n\nUse basic AI or rule-based matching to understand questions\n\nDisplay answers in a chatbot UI\n\nüî∏ OUT-OF-SCOPE (What it won‚Äôt do for now)\nNo live scraping or internet access\n\nNo voice inputs\n\nNo support for every type of question (just selected ones)\n\nNo user authentication or movie uploads (unless extended)\n\nüß± 5. MODULE BREAKDOWN\nLet‚Äôs break the project into baby-sized chunks or modules.\n\nModule\tDescription\nüé® Frontend UI\tChatbox for input/output (HTML + JS or React)\nüß† Backend Logic\tFlask server to receive/process questions\nüìö Movie Knowledge DB\tJSON file (or DB) with movie details: characters, scenes, endings, etc.\nüîç NLP/Intent Logic\tCode that understands what the user is asking\n‚ö†Ô∏è Spoiler Warnings\tOptional warnings before giving spoiler answers\n\nüîÑ 6. WORKFLOW (How things happen)\nüë§ User visits chatbot UI\n\nüìù User enters:\n\nMovie: Titanic\n\nQuestion: Does Jack die?\n\nüß† Backend reads movie and question\n\nüîç Backend identifies what‚Äôs being asked (intent = character fate)\n\nüìö Backend looks up the JSON or DB for the answer\n\nüó£Ô∏è Backend replies: ‚ÄúYes, Jack dies after saving Rose from the freezing ocean.‚Äù\n\nüí¨ Chatbot shows reply",

It allows users to input the name of a movie and ask specific plot-based questions like 'Does this character die?' or 'What happens in this scene?', and the chatbot responds with factual, spoiler-rich answers.\"\n\nThink of it as ChatGPT for spoilers, but only focused on movies/series.\n\nüéØ 3. OBJECTIVES (What do you want it to do?)\nüé• Take a movie/series name from the user\n\n‚ùì Take a specific question (e.g., ‚ÄúDoes X die?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat happens at the end?‚Äù)\n\nüìñ Find an answer from its memory (JSON or database)\n\nüó£Ô∏è Return a spoiler-based answer in natural language\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Optionally, warn the user before giving spoilers\n\nüîç 4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nüîπ IN-SCOPE (What it will do)\nHandle a limited set of movies (5‚Äì10 manually input for now)\n\nRespond to specific question types:\n\nCharacter fates (\"Does Jack die?\")\n\nKey scenes (\"What happens during the sinking?\")\n\nEndings (\"How does the movie end?\")\n\nUse basic AI or rule-based matching to understand questions\n\nDisplay answers in a chatbot UI\n\nüî∏ OUT-OF-SCOPE (What it won‚Äôt do for now)\nNo live scraping or internet access\n\nNo voice inputs\n\nNo support for every type of question (just selected ones)\n\nNo user authentication or movie uploads (unless extended)\n\nüß± 5. MODULE BREAKDOWN\nLet‚Äôs break the project into baby-sized chunks or modules.\n\nModule\tDescription\nüé® Frontend UI\tChatbox for input/output (HTML + JS or React)\nüß† Backend Logic\tFlask server to receive/process questions\nüìö Movie Knowledge DB\tJSON file (or DB) with movie details: characters, scenes, endings, etc.\nüîç NLP/Intent Logic\tCode that understands what the user is asking\n‚ö†Ô∏è Spoiler Warnings\tOptional warnings before giving spoiler answers\n\nüîÑ 6. WORKFLOW (How things happen)\nüë§ User visits chatbot UI\n\nüìù User enters:\n\nMovie: Titanic\n\nQuestion: Does Jack die?\n\nüß† Backend reads movie and question\n\nüîç Backend identifies what‚Äôs being asked (intent = character fate)\n\nüìö Backend looks up the JSON or DB for the answer\n\nüó£Ô∏è Backend replies: ‚ÄúYes, Jack dies after saving Rose from the freezing ocean.‚Äù\n\nüí¨ Chatbot shows reply",

Outputs: Command end executed:# Recent Accomplishments\n\nI've created a comprehensive JSON database containing detailed spoiler information for 10 popular movies and TV series to support the SpoilrAI project.\n\n## Deliverable\n- **movie_spoilers_db.json**: A structured database with detailed spoilers (/data/chats/iq2oe/workspace/movie_spoilers_db.json)\n\n## Database Content\n- 10 popular titles including Titanic, The Sixth Sense, Avengers: Endgame, Fight Club, Game of Thrones, etc.\n- For each title: character fates, key scenes, and complete ending descriptions\n- Optimized for answering specific spoiler questions (e.g., \"Does X die?\", \"What happens in scene Y?\")\n\nDo you see the created database file? Would you like me to make any adjustments to the data structure or content?\n\n### Next steps I could help with:\n1. Create a simple Flask backend that can process user questions about these movies\n2. Develop a basic frontend UI for the SpoilrAI chatbot\n3. Implement NLP logic to match user questions with appropriate spoiler information",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a world-class engineer, your goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, readable, maintainable, fully functional, and ready-for-production code.\nYou have been tasked with developing a web app or game.\nUnless the user or a system design specifies, or an existing repo is provided, you should use a React template with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - Outline all features to develop based on the user requirements. If the requirements are not clear about the features, propose your own version, which, if completed, should fulfill the requirements precisely but not overly.\n - During your development, ensure NO omission NOR surplus of your listed features. NO MORE, NO LESS. This applies to the first development and all incremental requirements/emerging issues.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - Navigate to the template to start the project, using ```cd {template_path}```. This step is CRUCIAL.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n2. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to create new code files or rewrite code files. Plan out all files and call write_new_code only once for all files. Make sure you include all files listed in the system design if given.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n4. Editor is used to edit a small part of a file. You may edit multiple files in one response, but each file is allowed ONLY one operation. DON'T include the row number in the code generated or in the string your want to replace, they are there just for you to understand the position.\n5. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, be mindful of white spaces and line breaks!\n6. After finishing the React/Vue project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you encounter any issues, fix them before proceeding.\n6.1. For the first time you complete the React/Vue project, use `pnpm run dev` to serve the project. Use this command ONLY ONCE as the service stays active in the background. DON'T serve the project again for incremental requirements.\n6.2. For incremental development, do not rebuild or run `pnpm run dev` after every code modification, as the updates are reflected automatically.\n7. Preview the project if you launch a service, using the `Terminal.preview` function. Use this command only after you have seen the actual port number. Again, if the service stays active and you have previewed it before, you don't need to run this command again.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue template.\n\n## Template\n\n### default_flask_project Template Intro\n1. A comprehensive Flask template with production-grade architecture.\n2. The template is at /template/default_python_project/flask_template.\n3.

OBJECTIVES (What do you want it to do?)\nüé• Take a movie/series name from the user\n\n‚ùì Take a specific question (e.g., ‚ÄúDoes X die?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat happens at the end?‚Äù)\n\nüìñ Find an answer from its memory (JSON or database)\n\nüó£Ô∏è Return a spoiler-based answer in natural language\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Optionally, warn the user before giving spoilers\n\nüîç 4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\nüîπ IN-SCOPE (What it will do)\nHandle a limited set of movies (5‚Äì10 manually input for now)\n\nRespond to specific question types:\n\nCharacter fates (\"Does Jack die?\")\n\nKey scenes (\"What happens during the sinking?\")\n\nEndings (\"How does the movie end?\")\n\nUse basic AI or rule-based matching to understand questions\n\nDisplay answers in a chatbot UI\n\nüî∏ OUT-OF-SCOPE (What it won‚Äôt do for now)\nNo live scraping or internet access\n\nNo voice inputs\n\nNo support for every type of question (just selected ones)\n\nNo user authentication or movie uploads (unless extended)\n\nüß± 5.

When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",
